[b][size=xx-large]Customgen[/size][/b]
[i]beta release 1 for 1.7.10[/i]

[b][size=6]Description[/size][/b]
Customgen is a mod that lets you to add player-created features to terrain generation. Generation features are saved as resource packs and may easily be shared with others. Customgen is based on the following things:

[b][size=5]Gens[/size][/b]
Short for generation feature, this is the base for a feature. A gen has a set of data, describing where and how it may generate. Currently it has a name, a resourcepack name, a level, a set of allowed biome types and a set of segments. A gens level will decide on what y level it will generate, the following values are available:
[list]
[*][b]underground[/b]: starts generating underground at y=4, y=20 or y=36
[*][b]surface[/b]: starts generating 3 blocks below the surface
[*][b]sea floor[/b]: works similar to surface but generates at the bottom of a sea, lake or river instead of at the surface of the water
[/list]
For a gen to generate in a biome, one of the biomes types has to match one of the biome types in the set of allowed biome types. An empty set means that all biome types are allowed. Last but not least we have the segments, this is where the actual content is stored.

[b][size=5]Segments[/size][/b]
Segments consists of a 16x16x16 cube of blocks with metadata and tile entities, this is what gets placed in the world when a gen generates. Segments have an interface number on each side, this describes what other segments that it may be fit to generate next to. A segment can be marked as a starting segment, when a gen generates into the world it will start with one its starting segments. Once the
starting segment has been generated segments that have interfaces matching the interfaces of the starting segment will also generate and then segments with interfaces matching the interfaces of those segments, and so on until there are no interfaces left to fit new segments onto (there's currently a limit on 100 segments to avoid generating infinite loops).

[b][size=5]Blocks & Items[/size][/b]
Customgen adds a couple of blocks and items that are used in creating gens.

[b]Book of Custom Generation[/b]
Used to create gens and segments or to generate gens, segments and templates.

[b]Empty Block[/b]
When the blocks in a segment is generated empty blocks will not be placed but instead leave the block previously generated by the vanilla (or another mods) terrain generation. Using these instead of stone lets a gen fit better into the existing terrain.

[b]Interface Block[/b]
Placing these on the side of a segment will add to its interface number on that side. Right click to increase its value. Multiple interface blocks may be placed on the same side.

[b]Loot placeholder[/b]
Loot placeholders inside inventories will be replaced with dungeon loot when it is generated, this should add more randomness and "replayability" to a gen.

[b][size=6]Download & Installation[/size][/b]
Available versions:
[list]
[*][url=http://www.mickelus.se/upl/customgen-R1-1.7.10.jar]Customgen release 1 for 1.7.10[/url]
[/list]
Customgen needs minecraft forge to run, download the installer from [url=http://files.minecraftforge.net/]here[/url] and run it. There should now be a folder called "mods" in your minecraft directory, place the customgen .jar file in that folder.


[b][size=5]Installing content[/size][/b]
Gens that you've created yourself should be ready to generate.
If you've downloaded gens created by someone else, place them in the resourcepacks folder and restart your world. If you're running a server you may have to create the resourcepacks folder first. You can use the Book of Custom Generation to check if the gens were properly added.

[b][size=6]Bug reports & feature requests[/size][/b]
I would prefer if you could post bug reports and feature requests over on the [url=https://github.com/mickelus/customgen/issues]github page[/url], it's easier to manage that way.
